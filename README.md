# hello-world
New here! Going to work through the free Intro to Ruby course.

I have ten years of customer service experience and have been recognized by upper management for my outstanding sense of leadership and my ability to recruit and train effective sales teams. Currently, I am hoping to shift into a corporate or management role in the retail industry.
